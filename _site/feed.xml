        <title>LeRoi Jones</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;LeRoi Jones was born in 1934 in Newark, New Jersey. Jones’ work spans a large
period of time and styles, mixing avant-garde poetry from the New York School
with radical and often incendiary and politically motivated subtext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jones had many identities throughout his tenure as a poet and writer. In the
1950s, he was mostly involved with white New York poets like Alan Ginsburg.
However, in the 1960s, his identity and writing began to transform into that
of a Black nationalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1965, after Malcolm X was assassinated, LeRoi Jones changed his name to
Amiri Baraka and moved to Harlem to form the Black Arts School which was
devoted to developing a new aesthetic for Black Artists, embracing Black
culture as a basis for art, while rejecting white culture’s influence on
their art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His poetry and writing became radical as he incorporated
more racial references in his writing. As he matured further, his identity
shifted into that of a Marxist, blaming capitalism for many of the problems
the Black community faced.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Black Magic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Magic&lt;/em&gt; by Amiri Baraka is a collection of poetry written by Baraka from
the time period of 1961 to 1967. This period of time was a period of transition
in Baraka’s life, as he began to shed his connections to the predominately white
New York School and embraced his Blackness and Black culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baraka separates this volume into 3 books: &lt;em&gt;Sabotage&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Target Study&lt;/em&gt;, and
&lt;em&gt;Black Art&lt;/em&gt;, each thematically representing a time in Baraka’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sabotage&quot;&gt;Sabotage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first book, &lt;em&gt;Sabotage&lt;/em&gt;, comes early in Baraka’s ouevre. As Baraka says
himself in the preface, his early work represented “a cloud of abstraction
and disjointedness that was just whiteness.” Baraka in this work seems to
attempt to appeal to “whiteness” by sticking to a style similar to the
avant-garde of the New York School. However, Baraka still maintains his
connection to Black culture making several references to race within his
poetry. The piece “Kenyatta Listening to Mozart” juxtaposes his connection
to Africa and Blackness with European Culture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/kenyatta.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenyatta was an anti-colonial activist in Kenya and became its first Prime
Minister. The title of the poem, “Kenyatta Listening to Mozart”, creates a
juxtaposition between Africa with Kenyatta and the West with Mozart. The
entire poem references this juxtaposition throughout its text. In the first
stanza, Baraka references the American poets in San Francisco, referencing
the Beat writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsburg that were associated
with San Francisco. In the next stanza, Baraka evokes imagery of Africa with his
references to “brush” and “undergrowth” while also contrasting that with the
imagery of “spats”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This juxtaposition creates an interesting parallel with Baraka’s life. In this
time period, Baraka began to question his roots as a Beats poet, while embracing
his own Blackness. This poem seems to highlight his own personal struggle with
appreciating his enjoyment for Western Art with his desire to become more
involved with a Black Power movement. It could also foreshadow his involvement
Black Nationalistic groups. The reference to Kenyatta could be a reference to
himself as he envisions himself a leader to bring revolution to a people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;target-study&quot;&gt;Target Study&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baraka described his work on &lt;em&gt;Target Study&lt;/em&gt; as “trying to really study,..less
passive now, less uselessly “literary”…trying to see, trying to understand…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Target Study&lt;/em&gt;, Baraka began to commit to his radical and controversial
style that defined Amiri Baraka. While &lt;em&gt;Sabotage&lt;/em&gt; remained invested in the
tropes common in Avant-Garde poetry, &lt;em&gt;Target Study&lt;/em&gt; mostly took a look at
Black culture. In the piece, “Black Bourgeoisie”, Baraka offers a stinging
commentary on the “Black Bourgeoisie” who Baraka thought had to shed their
internal Black self to appease whites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/black_bourgeois.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title “Black Bourgeoisie” itself is most likely a reference to the book,
&lt;em&gt;Black Bourgeoisie&lt;/em&gt;, published by E. Franklin Frazier, who himself was
referenced by Baraka in &lt;em&gt;Sabotage&lt;/em&gt; in the poem “Letter to E. Franklin Frazier”.
Frazier’s work was extremely controversial at the time since it criticized
middle class Black families that wanted to be accepted in white society by
shedding their own personal identity. Baraka was similarly critical of this
Black Bourgeoisie, stating that his own university, Howard, “let me understand
the Negro sickness. They teach you to pretend to be white.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poem, “Black Bourgeoisie”, references this criticism throughout the text. On
the surface, members of the Black Bourgeoisie care about the affairs of Black
people, but their real motivations are money and appealing to white people.
Baraka describes this hidden motivation in the double entendre “dreams about
Lincoln(s)”. Baraka references both Abraham Lincoln and both $5 bills with
Lincoln on them. This highlights the hidden motivations. In the last lines of
the poem, he writes that they do “hate ofays / hates, instead, him self / him
black self”. Ofays is a perjorative slang for white people. Baraka criticizes
the Black Bourgeoisie for liking white people instead of themselves and their
identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;black-art&quot;&gt;Black Art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final book in the collection
