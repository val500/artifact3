This period of time was a period of transition in Baraka’s life, as he began to shed his connections to the predominately white New York School and embraced his Blackness and Black culture.</p><p>Baraka separates this volume into 3 books: <em>Sabotage</em>, <em>Target Study</em>, and <em>Black Art</em>, each thematically representing a time in Baraka’s life.</p><h3 id="sabotage">Sabotage</h3><p>The first book, <em>Sabotage</em>, comes early in Baraka’s ouevre. As Baraka says himself in the preface, his early work represented “a cloud of abstraction and disjointedness that was just whiteness.” Baraka in this work seems to attempt to appeal to “whiteness” by sticking to a style similar to the avant-garde of the New York School. However, Baraka still maintains his connection to Black culture making several references to race within his poetry. The piece “Kenyatta Listening to Mozart” juxtaposes his connection to Africa and Blackness with European Culture:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/kenyatta.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p>Kenyatta was an anti-colonial activist in Kenya and became its first Prime Minister. The title of the poem, “Kenyatta Listening to Mozart”, creates a juxtaposition between Africa with Kenyatta and the West with Mozart. The entire poem references this juxtaposition throughout its text. In the first stanza, Baraka references the American poets in San Francisco, referencing the Beat writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsburg that were associated with San Francisco. In the next stanza, Baraka evokes imagery of Africa with his references to “brush” and “undergrowth” while also contrasting that with the imagery of “spats”.</p><p>This juxtaposition creates an interesting parallel with Baraka’s life. In this time period, Baraka began to question his roots as a Beats poet, while embracing his own Blackness. This poem seems to highlight his own personal struggle with appreciating his enjoyment for Western Art with his desire to become more involved with a Black Power movement. It could also foreshadow his involvement Black Nationalistic groups. The reference to Kenyatta could be a reference to himself as he envisions himself a leader to bring revolution to a people.</p><h3 id="target-study">Target Study</h3><p>Baraka described his work on <em>Target Study</em> as “trying to really study,..less passive now, less uselessly “literary”…trying to see, trying to understand…”</p><p>In <em>Target Study</em>, Baraka began to commit to his radical and controversial style that defined Amiri Baraka. While <em>Sabotage</em> remained invested in the tropes common in Avant-Garde poetry, <em>Target Study</em> mostly took a look at Black culture. In the piece, “Black Bourgeoisie”, Baraka offers a stinging commentary on the “Black Bourgeoisie” who Baraka thought had to shed their internal Black self to appease whites.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/black_bourgeois.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p>The title “Black Bourgeoisie” itself is most likely a reference to the book, <em>Black Bourgeoisie</em>, published by E. Franklin Frazier, who himself was referenced by Baraka in <em>Sabotage</em> in the poem “Letter to E. Franklin Frazier”. Frazier’s work was extremely controversial at the time since it criticized middle class Black families that wanted to be accepted in white society by shedding their own personal identity. Baraka was similarly critical of this Black Bourgeoisie, stating that his own university, Howard, “let me understand the Negro sickness. They teach you to pretend to be white.”</p><p>The poem, “Black Bourgeoisie”, references this criticism throughout the text. On the surface, members of the Black Bourgeoisie care about the affairs of Black people, but their real motivations are money and appealing to white people. Baraka describes this hidden motivation in the double entendre “dreams about Lincoln(s)”. Baraka references both Abraham Lincoln and both $5 bills with Lincoln on them. This highlights the hidden motivations. In the last lines of the poem, he writes that they do “hate ofays / hates, instead, him self / him black self”. Ofays is a perjorative slang for white people. Baraka criticizes the Black Bourgeoisie for liking white people instead of themselves and their identity.</p><h3 id="black-art">Black Art</h3><p>The final book in the collection represents a culmination of conflicting ideas and themes in Baraka’s work and becomes his most lucid and clear manifesto in this book about race. As Baraka himself states in the preface,</p><blockquote><p>“<em>Black Art</em> was the crucial seeing, the decisions, the actual move. The strengthening to destroy, and the developing of willpower to build, even in the face of destruction and despair, even with, or WITHOUT, the confrontation of blankness, whiteness, etc.”</p></blockquote><p>An early poem in the collection, titled “Black Art”, confronts this realization of the true purpose of his poetry.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/black_art1.png" alt="alt text" /> <img src="/assets/images/black_art2.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p>In a large way, this poem discusses Baraka’s realization of the true power of poetry, confronting his critics who claimed that poetry is best done without the influence of political motivation. Baraka explicitly calls this out in the first line where he calls poetry without teeth “bullshit”. He wants his poetry to have power, to fight against the injustices.</p><p>Baraka takes on a much more violent and radical tone in this poetry, unfiltered and unafraid to take on a force he believes to be unjust. He makes references to stealing weapons from cops, pulling their tongues out and leaving them for dead. This language is much more incendiary and aptly describes Baraka’s controversial tone.</p><p>Ultimately, throughout the course of <em>Black Magic</em>, themes of race and fighting for your race become more prominent as both the themes and style of writing become more incendiary and radical.</p><p><a href="/2017/04/15/tales/">Next: Tales</a></p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by Varun Valada</span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="subscribe" id="subscribe"><div class="subscribe__container"> <span class="subscribe__title">Varun Valada</span><p class="subscribe__text">English 1102</p></div></div><hr class="sep--white"/><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__tags"></ul></div></div></footer><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
