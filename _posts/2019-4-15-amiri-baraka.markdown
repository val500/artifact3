LeRoi Jones was born in 1934 in Newark, New Jersey. Jones' work spans a large
period of time and styles, mixing avant-garde poetry from the New York School
with radical and often incendiary and politically motivated subtext.

Jones had many identities throughout his tenure as a poet and writer. In the
1950s, he was mostly involved with white New York poets like Alan Ginsburg.
However, in the 1960s, his identity and writing began to transform into that
of a Black nationalist.

In 1965, after Malcolm X was assassinated, LeRoi Jones changed his name to
Amiri Baraka and moved to Harlem to form the Black Arts School which was
devoted to developing a new aesthetic for Black Artists, embracing Black
culture as a basis for art, while rejecting white culture's influence on
their art.

His poetry and writing became radical as he incorporated
more racial references in his writing. As he matured further, his identity
shifted into that of a Marxist, blaming capitalism for many of the problems
the Black community faced.
