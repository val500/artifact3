Throughout the late 1960s and 70s, Baraka published several essays and poetry
through a smaller, more obscure publication, "Jihad Publications". The name is
a reference to the Arabic word, "Jihad", describing a struggle. However, to
the word Jihad has a connotation of "Holy War", a connotation that Baraka might
have been trying to exploit to be as radical and revolutionary as possible.

His work under the Jihad Publications ranges from essays on Black Nationalism
to more poetry. One essay, titled "The National Black Assembly and the Black
Liberation Movement", from the early 70s, highlights Baraka's radicalism. Here
are some excerpts from the text (the full texts can be found at the bottom of
the page).

Despite Baraka's radicalism, and his anger towards whites, he does not place the
sole blame of problems Black people face towards White people; he instead blames
an entire capitalistic system for the exploitation of Black people and other
workers. This text highlights both Baraka's interest in Black Nationalism while
foreshadowing his eventual turn to Marxism.

In another essay, "Creating a Unified Conscousness", Baraka advocates for all
Blacks to join together in revolution. Here is an excerpt:

Baraka's advocacy for a unified front of Blacks, all joined to overthrow
power is extremely radical.
